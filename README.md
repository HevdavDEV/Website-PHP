# Website-PHP
I created a website using HTML, CSS, PHP, jQuery, Bootstrap, and some JavaScript. Has a backend, front-end, login/register.

This website uses Procedural and OOP PHP because I typed out my code in diffrent areas.<br>
It wasen't one big code. And I'm still learning OOP.<br>

There are a couple of files you need to change if you want the admin backend to work.

articles/config.php<br>
Set Database Name, Username and Password.<br>
Set admin Password and Username.

things_to_do/connect.php<br>
Set Database Name, Username and Password.<br>
Set admin Password and Username.

upcoming_articles/config.php<br>
Set Database Name, Username and Password.<br>
Set admin Password and Username.


comment/db/db.php<br>
Set Database Name, Username and Password.<br>


login/db_connect.php<br>
Set Database Name, Username and Password.<br>


main_admin/db_fns.php<br>
Set Database Name, Username and Password.<br>


contact_process.php<br>
Set YOUR email address in the $to section<br>

go into the 'admin' table that you made and set the admin password and username

go into the '_comments' table that you made and set isadmin for one of the users you made to '1'.<br>
( To add a user, just comment in the comment section in the things_to_do page. )<br>

This is not meant to be used commercially because it has security flaws.<br>
